            <h2>This looks fun.</h2>

            I'm going, if I can find time, to turn this into a techblog.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            Quick process. This is a quick reminder built with Vim and basic html.

            <ul>
                <li>Create a repository, public, with SSL enabled, and the {username}.github.io name.
                </li>
                <li>Turn Github Actions on, because CI/CD is good and cool.
                </li>
                <li>Turn it into a Hugo Site - because Hugo is nice and great.
                    Read this: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
                </li>
                <li>Enable Github submodules - Because HugoWebsites tend to run with themes which use Submodules.
                    I believe I only need to change the .gitmodules to pull on https?
                    Read this:
                    https://docs.github.com/fr/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-submodules-with-github-pages
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a footer at the bottom, using the method demonstrated by Walton:
                    https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dark mode (many tutorials out there, but would be nice to just pull a nice efficient library?)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Code in a TODO effect using text-decoration: linethrough and ui checkbox / glyphs (circle
                    outline + check circle sounds good)
                    Ideally, build that into the CSS for future usage
                </li>
                <li>
                    Theme Semantic appropriately using the recommanded method rather than quick-and-dirty edits of
                    the CSS I wrote
                </li>
                <li>
                    Theme Hugo using the recommanded method and a self-made Hugo Theme - likely building on
                    something basic from the Hugo Theme Library
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h2>Code test</h2>
                <pre><code class="Swift">let thereBe = "code"</code></pre>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Make sure the footer is visible when content isn't overlarge</td>
                </tr>
